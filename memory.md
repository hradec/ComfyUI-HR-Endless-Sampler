# SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited development memory

## Goal

This custom node adds `SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited`, a MiniMax H3-specific
replacement for ComfyUI's stock `SamplerCustomAdvanced`. Its purpose is to
sample a long joint video/audio latent as smaller temporal chunks so the H3 DiT
does not have to hold the complete video sequence in VRAM at once.

The node keeps the stock sampler inputs and delegates every individual chunk to
the stock `SamplerCustomAdvanced`. It adds:

- `clip`: the same MiniMax H3 CLIP/Qwen model used by the upstream conditioning
  node;
- `prompt`: the original MiniMax-formatted prompt;
- `fps`: the frame rate used to convert prompt timestamps to global frames;
- `chunk_frames`: the maximum number of H3 frames sampled at once;
- `context_frames`: the completed H3-valid tail carried into every later
  chunk, defaulting to five frames;
- `debug`: logs each chunk's rewritten prompt and frame ranges to the ComfyUI
  console and returns the same text through `chunk_prompts`;
- `debug_stop_chunk`: returns after the selected 1-based serial chunk for fast
  boundary diagnostics; zero keeps the normal complete run;
- optional `images`: pixel images needed to rebuild Qwen visual conditioning.

The sampler node id and display name are both:

```text
SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited
```

An optional model-patch node provides the accumulated live preview:

```text
MiniMaxH3UnlimitedPreview -> MiniMax H3 Unlimited Preview
```

## Development history and decisions

The first implementation used independent, strictly serial stock sampler calls.
It completed an approximately 356-frame Ref2VA render, represented as 362
frames on H3's valid temporal grid in logged tests, with roughly 30 percent
less peak VRAM than sampling the complete latent at once. This proved the basic
memory-saving design, but later chunks sometimes replayed actions or appeared
to contain two interpretations of the same shot joined together.

The serial implementation was then extended with exact per-chunk prompt logging,
sentence/clause ownership for shots that span boundaries, native accumulated
previews, and clearer continuation instructions. A proposed change that removed
a trailing phrase such as `The tiger stops` from a later prompt was reverted
after the same duplicate-shot symptom was found inside the first chunk. That
observation showed the phrase alone was not the root cause. The current parser
still assigns action units by their proportional position in the global shot;
debug output makes that assignment visible instead of silently discarding text.

A second architecture was tested to see whether one global latent and one
diffusion schedule could preserve more state. It evaluated every temporal
window during each diffusion step. This experiment produced deterministic
changes at window boundaries and could not supply completed continuation frames
to later windows. It was abandoned and the serial architecture was restored.

The restored path was compared directly with serial commit `4be0ad9`: prompt
rewriting, completed-tail conditioning, trimming, and stock sampler delegation
were unchanged when the serial path was restored. Later sampler additions are
`debug_stop_chunk`, the outer chunk progress bar, and configurable
`context_frames`. The experimental global-window commit remains on the separate
`improve-windowed-sampling` branch and an associated stash is inert; neither is
part of the active `restore-serial-continuation` branch.

The accumulated preview subsequently gained real Tiny-VAE selection,
native-resolution mode, sampling telemetry, two graphs, live elapsed time, and
paired chunk/step visibility. The separate `Previewer: ...` browser row was
removed; decoder selection and fallback are still reported in the ComfyUI log.

## MiniMax H3 latent structure

H3 samples a nested AV latent containing two tensors:

```text
video: [B, 24, T_video, H/16, W/16]
audio: [B, 32, 2, T_audio]
```

The video temporal axis is not one latent step per pixel frame. H3 uses the
repeating frame coverage:

```text
FRAME_PER_TOKEN = (1, 4, 4, 4, 4)
```

Therefore a valid `17k + 5` pixel-frame sequence has `5k + 2` video latent
steps. Examples:

| Pixel frames | Video latent steps |
| ---: | ---: |
| 5 | 2 |
| 22 | 7 |
| 39 | 12 |
| 124 | 37 |
| 243 | 72 |
| 362 | 107 |

H3 audio latents run at 40 Hz while video normally runs at 24 FPS. The expected
audio length is:

```text
round(pixel_frames * 40 / 24)
```

The node validates both the video grid and the matching audio duration before
chunking. Invalid nested shapes fail clearly rather than producing an
incorrectly synchronized latent.

## Temporal chunk planning

`chunk_frames` is snapped down to H3's `17k + 5` grid. The default is 124
frames, or 37 video latent steps.

The first chunk contributes its complete latent. Every later chunk contains a
`context_frames` continuation prefix followed by new frames. Valid values are
5, 22, 39, 56, and so on. They correspond to 2, 7, 12, 17, and so on video
latent steps. `context_frames` must be smaller than the effective snapped
`chunk_frames` value.

`chunk_frames` remains the total amount sampled in one stock call, including
the repeated prefix. Increasing `context_frames` therefore reduces the new
content produced by later chunks and can increase the number of sampler calls;
it does not silently increase the temporal VRAM cap.

With the default five-frame context, two 124-frame chunks deliver:

```text
124 + (124 - 5) = 243 frames
```

In latent steps this is:

```text
37 + (37 - 2) = 72 video latent steps
```

The configured context latent steps are removed before final assembly. This
keeps the result on H3's native grid and makes the returned video latent exactly
the same shape as the upstream requested latent.

### Audio rounding at boundaries

The configured context duration normally corresponds to a fractional number of
40 Hz audio steps. For the default five frames it is 8.333 steps, so a join uses
eight or nine context steps. The planner calculates cumulative global audio
boundaries and chooses the matching integer length for every boundary. This
avoids accumulating audio/video drift across a long sequence and works the same
way for longer context values.

The previous chunk's audio endpoint can overhang or underhang its final pixel
frame by a fraction of one 40 Hz step because of rounding. The audio guide's
start position includes this signed offset, matching H3's native timeline
layout rather than assuming every chunk ends on an exact audio boundary.

## Noise behavior

The input noise object generates noise once for the complete requested latent
on the CPU/intermediate device. Each chunk receives the corresponding video and
audio slices through a small fixed-noise wrapper.

This was chosen instead of asking the input noise object to generate each chunk
independently because equally shaped chunks generated from the same seed could
repeat the same noise. Slicing one full deterministic noise value preserves a
stable global noise field and supports custom ComfyUI noise implementations.

The sampler seed passed to H3 is incremented for each chunk. The fixed noise
itself still comes from the original global seed; the incremented sampling seed
keeps H3's conditioning-side stochastic behavior distinct between chunks.

## Continuation from the previous generation

The node does not use the first frame of the previous generation. It uses the
previous sampled chunk's final latent tail:

```text
context_video_steps = ((context_frames - 5) // 17) * 5 + 2
video_context = previous_video[:, :, -context_video_steps:]
audio_context = previous_audio[..., -context_audio_steps:]
```

These tensors are cloned so they do not keep long-lived views into a larger
chunk tensor.

The video tail is added to positive conditioning as a native H3 guide at local
frame zero:

```python
{"resolved_frame_index": 0, "latent": video_context}
```

The matching audio tail is added as a separate native audio guide. Its start is
chosen so its endpoint aligns with the configured video prefix, including the
previous chunk's fractional audio-grid overhang.

The prefix is guide conditioning, not a decode/re-encode round trip. Reusing
the sampler output directly has three benefits:

- it avoids needing the video VAE and audio VAE for generated continuation;
- it avoids VAE quality loss at every link in the chain;
- it is cheaper than decoding the previous video to images and encoding it
  again as Ref2VA media.

After sampling, the configured video and audio context steps are removed. Only
new content is appended to the final output.

### Failed approach: one latent sampled through temporal windows

The experimental implementation kept one full noisy latent and evaluated all
temporal windows during every denoising step. Its intended benefit was to retain
one global sigma schedule and sampler invocation while limiting each model
forward to one temporal window.

The first variant blended predictions in overlapping window regions. It caused
visible duplicate transitions at exact overlap boundaries, observed at frames
51 and 102 in a diagnostic render. Both neighboring windows were predicting
the overlap from different temporal and prompt contexts, so averaging them did
not make them one coherent prediction.

The second variant assigned each output region to only one window and treated
the overlap as context. It removed overlap averaging but moved the visible
changes to the single-owner output boundaries, observed at frames 56 and 107.
It could also place Shot 2 before its requested global cut.

The fundamental problem affects both variants: during diffusion step N, the
next window is sampled before the previous window has completed steps N+1
through the end of the sigma schedule. Its tail is still noisy and cannot be
the final completed frames required by MiniMax's continuation method.
Passing a partially denoised overlap is not equivalent to conditioning on a
completed previous clip. The later window can independently reinterpret the
end of the prior shot, producing the observed replay, fade, early cut, or
glued-double-shot behavior.

The console exposed this architecture clearly: `Chunk 1/N` through `Chunk N/N`
repeated inside every diffusion step. In the restored serial path, chunk 1 runs
its complete step progress before chunk 2 begins its own complete progress.

The global-window architecture was removed instead of retaining another blend,
weighting, or boundary heuristic. Serial stock sampler calls are the current
behavior because each continuation begins from actual completed video and audio
latents.

### Attention state is not continuation memory

ComfyUI's sampler does not retain an attention buffer that can be detached from
one H3 invocation and injected into another. Attention keys, queries, values,
and intermediate activations are temporary results tied to a particular latent,
timestep, prompt presentation, and model forward. The stock sampler's persistent
state is the evolving latent and sampler algorithm state, not a reusable model
memory describing characters or props.

Within a chunk, H3 maintains appearance through the complete current latent,
prompt tokens, keyframes, and Ref2VA references. Across serial chunks this node
can carry only explicit model inputs: the completed latent tail, synchronized
audio tail, prompt conditioning, and reusable references. This is why an
invented detail such as a tiara can drift if it is absent or unclear in those
inputs.

H3 accepts longer native continuation clips only on its `17k + 5` frame grid:
5, 22, 39, 56 frames, and so on. `context_frames` now exposes these lengths.
The planner derives the matching video latent steps and synchronized audio tail,
excludes the complete carried interval from new prompt action ownership, trims
it from both sampler outputs, and tells the preview to hide it. Longer context
may preserve more visual history, but it repeats more computation, creates more
chunks for a fixed `chunk_frames`, and can overconstrain motion or replay prior
action.

## Existing H3 conditioning

The sampler receives a guider whose `original_conds` already contains converted
conditioning dictionaries. The implementation clones these dictionaries for
each chunk and restores the original guider state in a `finally` block.

Only positive conditioning is changed. Negative or other guider branches remain
untouched.

Existing `minimax_keyframes` use global resolved frame positions. For each
chunk, keyframes intersecting that chunk are copied and remapped to local frame
positions:

```text
local position = global position - chunk global start
```

This allows an upstream first-frame or last-frame guide to affect only the
chunk containing that global frame. Existing `minimax_refs`, control metadata,
and other conditioning fields are preserved.

## MiniMax shot prompt handling

The implementation follows the official MiniMax prompt guides:

- `[Shot 1]` is the opening shot and has no timestamp.
- Every later shot uses `[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm,`.
- Shot numbers must start at one and increase sequentially.
- Cut timestamps must be strictly increasing.

The parser recognizes both official description fields:

```text
integrated_multimodal_description:
detailed_description:
```

The first is used by T2VA/I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA prompts. The second is used by
full-reference prompts. Prefix sections such as `subject_definitions`,
`summary`, and `retention_analysis`, and suffix sections such as
`overall_soundscape` and `non_diegetic_music`, are preserved.

For each chunk, the parser:

1. converts every absolute `MM:SS.mmm` timestamp to a global frame using
   `round(seconds * fps)`;
2. treats a shot as active when its global interval intersects the chunk's
   global interval;
3. removes shot bodies that do not intersect the chunk;
4. renumbers the active opening shot to `[Shot 1]` and makes it untimed;
5. subtracts the chunk's global start frame from every later cut;
6. converts each local cut frame back to `MM:SS.mmm` for Qwen.

For example, at 24 FPS:

```text
global cut frame: 100
chunk global start: 50
local cut frame: 50
local cut time: 00:02.083
```

When a chunk begins in the middle of a long shot, the text body is retained but
prefixed with an explicit instruction to continue from the provided opening
frames without restarting or replaying earlier actions. A leading `the camera
cuts to` / `the shot transitions to` phrase is changed to describe the
continuing shot. Natural-language prose cannot otherwise be safely divided at
an arbitrary frame boundary. The carried video/audio latent tail establishes
the actual starting state.

If a shot spans a chunk boundary, the node maps its sentence-level action units
proportionally across the shot's global frame interval. A unit is retained in
every new-content interval that it overlaps. The configured latent overlap is
excluded from that action range because it is continuation context and is
trimmed from the assembled output. This matters for sparse descriptions: a
single sentence can span more than one chunk, and removing it from later chunks
leaves MiniMax with no concrete shot description and can cause an unintended
cut or a new interpretation based only on reference images. The continuation
instruction and completed opening frames tell MiniMax not to restart the
overlapping sentence's action.

This division explains apparently isolated phrases in debug output. For
example, `The tiger stops` is not selected by meaning or by taking an arbitrary
number of trailing words. It is a sentence/clause unit whose proportional span
overlaps that chunk's new-content interval. Removing one observed phrase does
not solve a boundary problem and can remove an action from the global story
entirely.

Prompt timing remains global even though each sampler call receives local
timestamps. For example, with `context_frames=5`, if a global cut is at frame
59 and a chunk samples frames 51-106, the rewritten cut is local frame 8. Only
global frames 56-58 are new content before that cut. Such a three-frame runway
is valid mathematically but difficult for a generative model. Very small chunks
or longer context can therefore make a boundary-adjacent cut unstable even when
timestamp conversion and latent handoff are correct.

## Replacing only prompt-owned conditioning

The original prompt has already been processed by MiniMax's Qwen3-VL text
encoder when it reaches the guider. Arbitrary text cannot be inserted directly
into the final hidden-state tensor. The node therefore needs the original
`clip` and prompt.

For each chunk it tokenizes and encodes the rewritten prompt, then replaces
only these positive-conditioning fields:

```text
cross_attn
minimax_token_tags
```

These are the fields owned by the Qwen prompt presentation. The node does not
replace latent references, keyframes, controls, sampler settings, or unrelated
metadata.

## What the `images` input means

The optional `images` input is used only to reconstruct Qwen/CLIP visual
conditioning. It does not create H3 video-VAE or audio-VAE latents.

For ordinary I2VA/FL2VA conditioning, the image batch is interpreted as:

```text
images[0] -> <Picture 1> / original first-frame image
images[1] -> <Picture 2> / optional original last-frame image
```

The first image is resized to the generation canvas with the same stretched
geometry-anchor behavior used by the stock H3 node. Later images use
aspect-preserving center crop, matching the stock last-frame behavior.

For image-only Ref2VA, each batch item is a separate picture reference:

```text
images[0] -> <Picture 1>
images[1] -> <Picture 2>
images[2] -> <Picture 3>
```

The image references are reconstructed in the same order as the existing
`minimax_refs` payload. Audio-only reference blocks contribute their `<Audio N>`
labels to Qwen but need no waveform here because their audio latents already
exist in `minimax_refs`.

This explains why the current node does not take a video VAE or audio VAE:

- the `images` input supplies only pixels for Qwen visual tokens;
- upstream keyframes and Ref2VA blocks are already VAE-encoded in the guider;
- previous generated video and audio are already available as sampled latents.

Ordinary I2VA/FL2VA images are presented to Qwen only for the first chunk.
Presenting them again would relabel the original image as a fresh local
`<Picture 1>` and repeat its zero-second alignment instruction, competing with
the previous chunk's latent continuation guide. Later ordinary chunks remove
those picture-alignment lines and replace remaining picture-label prose with a
neutral reference to the already established subject and scene. Image-only
Ref2VA inputs are different: they describe reusable identity, scene, motion, or
style references and remain presented to every chunk.

## Why an IMAGE batch is not a Ref2VA video

An IMAGE batch normally represents separate `<Picture N>` references. A
Ref2VA `<Video N>` has additional temporal structure:

- all frames belong to one ordered media item;
- Qwen samples the video at 2 FPS and inserts timestamps;
- the video VAE encodes the complete temporal sequence as one reference latent;
- an optional synchronized soundtrack is encoded by the audio VAE;
- the prompt refers to the sequence as `<Video N>`, not as many pictures.

Consequently, the node refuses existing `video` or `video_audio` Ref2VA blocks
when rebuilding Qwen conditioning from `images`. Silently treating those frames
as separate pictures would make the Qwen presentation disagree with the DiT
reference payload.

Correct support for new Ref2VA videos would require dedicated inputs such as:

- one or more separately delimited `ref_video` IMAGE sequences;
- the MiniMax video VAE;
- optional reference-video audio and the MiniMax audio VAE;
- an explicit choice between a full reusable reference and a reference aligned
  one-to-one with the target's global timeline.

For a timeline-aligned source, each chunk would have to slice the raw frames,
snap them to H3's temporal grid, sample the same slice at 2 FPS for Qwen,
VAE-encode the slice, and replace the corresponding `minimax_refs` video block.
If it has synchronized audio, that audio must be sliced and encoded on the same
timeline. For identity, appearance, general motion, camera, or style references,
the complete reference video should normally remain available to every chunk
instead of being timeline-sliced.

None of this is needed for continuation from the immediately preceding
generated chunk; direct latent-tail guides are the more accurate path.

## Stock sampler delegation and output assembly

Every planned chunk is placed in a temporary latent dictionary and passed to:

```python
SamplerCustomAdvanced.execute(...)
```

This preserves ComfyUI's normal sampler, sigma, callback, preview, model
loading, offloading, dtype, and backend behavior. The custom node does not
implement a separate diffusion sampler.

Chunks run strictly in sequence. The next stock sampler call is not created
until the previous call has finished and its final video/audio latent tail has
been cloned into native H3 continuation conditioning. A dedicated tqdm line
shows `Chunk N/total` above the stock sampler's normal per-step progress.

`debug_stop_chunk` truncates the execution plan only after the complete global
prompt timeline has been calculated. This means a diagnostic partial result
uses exactly the same prompt intervals and continuation data as those chunks
would use during a full run. The default value is zero and does not truncate.

Both stock outputs are collected:

```text
output
denoised_output
```

Continuation prefixes are trimmed from both, and their video and audio streams
are concatenated independently. The final tensors are wrapped in a new
`NestedTensor`. Their shapes match the original upstream H3 AV latent exactly.

Non-H3 or non-nested latents fall through to the stock sampler unchanged.

## Accumulated live preview

`MiniMax H3 Unlimited Preview` is a separate model-patch node. Its MODEL output
must feed the guider passed to `SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited`. Keeping the
preview at the model boundary follows ComfyUI's existing outer-sampler wrapper
contract and avoids adding UI or transport behavior to the sampler itself.

At the start of one Unlimited execution, `nodes.py` finds wrappers registered
under the private `minimax_h3_unlimited_preview` key and opens a short-lived
preview session. Before each stock sampler call it supplies:

```text
chunk index and count
sampled global frame range
assembled-output frame range
number of carried video latent steps to hide
```

The wrapper observes the normal stock sampler callback. It restores the H3
video stream from either a nested AV value or ComfyUI's flattened sampler
representation, removes the configured carried latent steps from later
previews, and decodes the remaining latent positions. The original callback
still runs, so ComfyUI's normal progress and preview behavior are preserved.

Two decode modes are available:

- `tiny_vae: none` applies the H3 latent-format RGB factors in one tensor
  operation. This is the cheapest path but only an approximation.
- A compatible 24-channel flat decoder such as `taeh3.safetensors` is built
  from its checkpoint-defined layer indices and decodes one latent position at
  a time. This limits peak activation memory while producing a more useful RGB
  preview. The decoder weights exist only for the current Unlimited execution
  and are released when it finishes.

`max_resolution: 0` keeps the decoder's native output size. Positive values cap
the longest preview side. The wrapper sends encoded resolution, FPS, rolling
step duration, ETA inputs, sigma schedule, latent-change magnitude, and
step-time samples to the local widget. The browser draws the two telemetry
graphs for the active chunk while retaining completed chunk media in its
playlist. It also measures total elapsed sampling time from the reset event,
updates it once per second, and freezes the final value on completion. Decoder
selection is intentionally not given a separate UI row.

Every sampling event carries the execution id, chunk count, sigma schedule, and
backend elapsed time. If a browser refresh misses the original reset event, the
new widget adopts the next event for the still-running execution, reconstructs
its timer and graph scale, and resumes when the next encoded preview arrives.
This follows the useful recovery behavior observed in KJ's preview override
without retaining large preview tensors or media in server-global state.

For the active chunk, the browser keeps each received step WebP until the next
chunk starts. Hovering either graph maps the pointer's horizontal position to a
sampling boundary, draws the same vertical marker on both graphs, updates their
values, pauses the chunk playlist, and displays that step's animated preview.
Leaving the graph returns to the newest active chunk and resumes playback.
Intermediate previews may be absent if the bounded encoder intentionally drops
an outdated job while a newer step is waiting.

The browser does not replace a chunk while that chunk is already playing. New
sampling-step WebPs update its cached source and become visible on the next
playlist pass. The next chunk's duration timer starts only after its replacement
image has loaded, so decode latency cannot consume part of that chunk's playback
slot or make it appear to begin inside the preceding chunk.

`frame_stride` chooses every Nth H3 latent position. Animated-frame durations
still use H3's `(1, 4, 4, 4, 4)` pixel-frame coverage, so skipped positions do
not speed up playback. Cumulative millisecond rounding keeps the total WebP
duration equal to the represented pixel-frame duration at the selected `fps`.

PIL WebP compression runs on a bounded background worker. When encoding falls
behind, the queued intermediate step is replaced by the latest one instead of
blocking diffusion. Tiny-VAE and Latent2RGB decoding happen before that worker;
therefore tiny-VAE preview can slow sampling, and `frame_stride` is the direct
control for reducing that cost.

Each event transfers only the current chunk's animated WebP. The browser stores
one data URL and duration per chunk, replaces the active chunk as denoising
progresses, and loops over every available chunk. Earlier chunks are neither
decoded nor sent again. A reset event clears stale media at the next execution,
and a completion event leaves the assembled preview playing. Each replacement
WebP is preloaded before its source is assigned to the visible image, keeping
the previous preview on screen instead of exposing the widget's black background
for one browser animation frame.

Preview loading, decoding, encoding, and event-send errors are non-fatal. An
invalid tiny decoder is disabled for that execution and falls back to
Latent2RGB. Preview state contains no network client or outbound request; it
uses ComfyUI's local websocket event path.

## LoRA scheduling finding

ComfyUI exposes hook/keyframe nodes that can schedule LoRA strength across
diffusion percentages. In principle that can apply an ordinary compatible LoRA
only during selected steps, and a serial sampler would repeat the same schedule
for every chunk.

The installed hook LoRA loader did not map the tested MiniMax H3 Turbo LoRA
format. The console printed `lora key not loaded` for the H3 blocks and reported
`0 patches attached`. A known working run through the ordinary H3-compatible
LoRA loader reported `208 patches attached`. With a six-step Turbo schedule,
zero patches means the model is effectively being sampled for only six steps
without the distillation LoRA and can produce chaotic or under-denoised output.

For the tested Turbo LoRA, use the ordinary loader path that reports the
expected attached patches and keep it active for all intended Turbo steps. Do
not diagnose such a result as a serial continuation failure until the model-load
line confirms that the LoRA actually attached.

## Current limitations

- Chunking reduces temporal DiT memory, not the memory required for one
  high-resolution frame. It cannot guarantee arbitrary spatial resolution.
- The upstream H3 latent nodes may impose their own user-interface duration
  maximum even though the sampler planner itself works with longer valid
  latents.
- Chunked denoise masks are rejected. Slicing and synchronizing nested AV masks
  needs a separate, explicitly designed path.
- New Ref2VA video media is unsupported for the reasons above. Existing image
  and audio reference presentations can be rebuilt.
- Prompt cut timing remains generative guidance. Rewriting a cut to the correct
  local timestamp does not make diffusion frame-exact in the way a deterministic
  video editor would be.
- A cut placed only a few new frames after a continuation prefix can be
  unstable. Increasing `chunk_frames` or choosing boundaries farther from cuts
  gives H3 more temporal runway without changing the requested global cut.
- Identity details invented during generation are not guaranteed to persist
  across chunks unless they are visible in the carried frames, described in the
  prompt, or fixed by reusable reference media.
- Full-reference prefix analysis sections remain present even when their
  detailed shots are outside the current chunk. They preserve label meanings,
  but may still describe the overall video rather than only the local window.

## Verification performed

The implementation was checked with the Python environment used by the running
ComfyUI installation.

Completed checks include:

- Python compilation of `__init__.py`, `nodes.py`, and `preview.py`;

- context lengths of 5, 22, 39, 56, and 107 frames with exact reconstructed
  output sizes and synchronized audio trimming;
- mocked `context_frames=22` serial execution proving that later chunks receive
  the previous completed seven-step video tail and matching audio tail;
- restoration of the guider's original conditioning after sampling;
- serial proof with the default five-frame context that chunk two receives
  chunk one's completed two-step video tail and synchronized audio tail before
  its sampler call starts;
- `debug_stop_chunk=2` partial video/audio output sizes and unchanged prompt
  timing against the complete global plan;
- remapping of global first/last-frame keyframes;
- replacement of `cross_attn` and `minimax_token_tags` for every chunk;
- official base-prompt and full-reference description field parsing;

  rewriting a leading `camera cut to` as an already-established continuing
  view;

- clear rejection of video Ref2VA conditioning from an IMAGE-only input;
- registration of `MiniMaxH3UnlimitedPreview` and its web directory through
  ComfyUI's real custom-node loader;
- CPU loading and decoding with the installed 24-channel
  `taeh3.safetensors` checkpoint;
- Latent2RGB wrapper callback delivery and reset/chunk/complete event order;
- preview sample-start/progress telemetry, native-resolution dimensions, and
  active decoder reporting;
- JavaScript syntax and lifecycle review for the elapsed timer, completion
  freeze, removal cleanup, and removal of the separate previewer status row;
- JavaScript lifecycle review for refresh recovery from an in-progress event
  and interactive graph-step preview selection with a synchronized vertical
  marker;
- animated WebP creation and exact 124-frame/119-frame playback durations at
  24 FPS.

Manual GPU/log observations also established:

- the original serial implementation completed a long multi-chunk render with
  materially lower peak VRAM;
- the failed global approach changed windows during each sampler step and made
  artifacts at its exact overlap/ownership boundaries;
- the restored implementation runs a complete sigma schedule per chunk;
- later serial conditioning receives the previous chunk's completed final two
  video latent positions rather than an unfinished per-step overlap;
- the tested scheduled Hook LoRA path attached zero H3 patches, while the known
  working ordinary loader attached 208.

A full MiniMax H3 GPU render was not run as part of the lightweight automated
verification. The mocked path exercised chunk planning, prompt replacement,
conditioning mutation, continuation guide construction, trimming, and final
shape assembly without loading the large model.

# SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited development memory

## Goal

This custom node adds `SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited`, a MiniMax H3-specific
replacement for ComfyUI's stock `SamplerCustomAdvanced`. Its purpose is to
sample a long joint video/audio latent as smaller temporal chunks so the H3 DiT
does not have to hold the complete video sequence in VRAM at once.

The node keeps the stock sampler inputs and delegates every individual chunk to
the stock `SamplerCustomAdvanced`. It adds:

- `clip`: the same MiniMax H3 CLIP/Qwen model used by the upstream conditioning
  node;
- `prompt`: the original MiniMax-formatted prompt;
- `fps`: the frame rate used to convert prompt timestamps to global frames;
- `chunk_frames`: the maximum number of H3 frames sampled at once;
- optional `images`: pixel images needed to rebuild Qwen visual conditioning.

The registered node id and display name are both:

```text
SamplerCustomAdvanced-Unlimited
```

## Files

- `__init__.py` registers the node through `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and
  `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`.
- `nodes.py` contains chunk planning, prompt rewriting, Qwen conditioning
  rebuilding, continuation guides, sampling, and output assembly.
- `README.md` contains concise user-facing setup and limitations.
- `memory.md` is this implementation and design handoff.

## MiniMax H3 latent structure

H3 samples a nested AV latent containing two tensors:

```text
video: [B, 24, T_video, H/16, W/16]
audio: [B, 32, 2, T_audio]
```

The video temporal axis is not one latent step per pixel frame. H3 uses the
repeating frame coverage:

```text
FRAME_PER_TOKEN = (1, 4, 4, 4, 4)
```

Therefore a valid `17k + 5` pixel-frame sequence has `5k + 2` video latent
steps. Examples:

| Pixel frames | Video latent steps |
| ---: | ---: |
| 5 | 2 |
| 22 | 7 |
| 39 | 12 |
| 124 | 37 |
| 243 | 72 |
| 362 | 107 |

H3 audio latents run at 40 Hz while video normally runs at 24 FPS. The expected
audio length is:

```text
round(pixel_frames * 40 / 24)
```

The node validates both the video grid and the matching audio duration before
chunking. Invalid nested shapes fail clearly rather than producing an
incorrectly synchronized latent.

## Temporal chunk planning

`chunk_frames` is snapped down to H3's `17k + 5` grid. The default is 124
frames, or 37 video latent steps.

The first chunk contributes its complete latent. Every later chunk contains a
five-frame continuation prefix followed by new frames. Five frames correspond
to the final two video latent steps because a valid chunk ends on the same
`1, 4` phase of `FRAME_PER_TOKEN`.

For two 124-frame chunks, the delivered duration is consequently:

```text
124 + (124 - 5) = 243 frames
```

In latent steps this is:

```text
37 + (37 - 2) = 72 video latent steps
```

The repeated two-step prefix is removed before final assembly. This keeps the
result on H3's native grid and makes the returned video latent exactly the same
shape as the upstream requested latent.

### Audio rounding at boundaries

Five frames correspond to 8.333 audio steps, so the amount trimmed at a join
cannot always be a fixed integer. The planner calculates cumulative global
audio boundaries and chooses eight or nine context steps as needed. This avoids
accumulating audio/video drift across a long sequence.

The previous chunk's audio endpoint can overhang or underhang its final pixel
frame by a fraction of one 40 Hz step because of rounding. The audio guide's
start position includes this signed offset, matching H3's native timeline
layout rather than assuming every chunk ends on an exact audio boundary.

## Noise behavior

The input noise object generates noise once for the complete requested latent
on the CPU/intermediate device. Each chunk receives the corresponding video and
audio slices through a small fixed-noise wrapper.

This was chosen instead of asking the input noise object to generate each chunk
independently because equally shaped chunks generated from the same seed could
repeat the same noise. Slicing one full deterministic noise value preserves a
stable global noise field and supports custom ComfyUI noise implementations.

The sampler seed passed to H3 is incremented for each chunk. The fixed noise
itself still comes from the original global seed; the incremented sampling seed
keeps H3's conditioning-side stochastic behavior distinct between chunks.

## Continuation from the previous generation

The node does not use the first frame of the previous generation. It uses the
previous sampled chunk's final latent tail:

```text
video_context = previous_video[:, :, -2:]
audio_context = previous_audio[..., -context_audio_steps:]
```

These tensors are cloned so they do not keep long-lived views into a larger
chunk tensor.

The video tail is added to positive conditioning as a native H3 guide at local
frame zero:

```python
{"resolved_frame_index": 0, "latent": video_context}
```

The matching audio tail is added as a separate native audio guide. Its start is
chosen so its endpoint aligns with the five-frame video prefix, including the
previous chunk's fractional audio-grid overhang.

The prefix is guide conditioning, not a decode/re-encode round trip. Reusing
the sampler output directly has three benefits:

- it avoids needing the video VAE and audio VAE for generated continuation;
- it avoids VAE quality loss at every link in the chain;
- it is cheaper than decoding the previous video to images and encoding it
  again as Ref2VA media.

After sampling, the repeated two video latent steps and corresponding eight or
nine audio steps are removed. Only new content is appended to the final output.

## Existing H3 conditioning

The sampler receives a guider whose `original_conds` already contains converted
conditioning dictionaries. The implementation clones these dictionaries for
each chunk and restores the original guider state in a `finally` block.

Only positive conditioning is changed. Negative or other guider branches remain
untouched.

Existing `minimax_keyframes` use global resolved frame positions. For each
chunk, keyframes intersecting that chunk are copied and remapped to local frame
positions:

```text
local position = global position - chunk global start
```

This allows an upstream first-frame or last-frame guide to affect only the
chunk containing that global frame. Existing `minimax_refs`, control metadata,
and other conditioning fields are preserved.

## MiniMax shot prompt handling

The implementation follows the official MiniMax prompt guides:

- `[Shot 1]` is the opening shot and has no timestamp.
- Every later shot uses `[Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm,`.
- Shot numbers must start at one and increase sequentially.
- Cut timestamps must be strictly increasing.

The parser recognizes both official description fields:

```text
integrated_multimodal_description:
detailed_description:
```

The first is used by T2VA/I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA prompts. The second is used by
full-reference prompts. Prefix sections such as `subject_definitions`,
`summary`, and `retention_analysis`, and suffix sections such as
`overall_soundscape` and `non_diegetic_music`, are preserved.

For each chunk, the parser:

1. converts every absolute `MM:SS.mmm` timestamp to a global frame using
   `round(seconds * fps)`;
2. treats a shot as active when its global interval intersects the chunk's
   global interval;
3. removes shot bodies that do not intersect the chunk;
4. makes the active opening shot untimed;
5. subtracts the chunk's global start frame from every later cut;
6. converts each local cut frame back to `MM:SS.mmm` for Qwen.

For example, at 24 FPS:

```text
global cut frame: 100
chunk global start: 50
local cut frame: 50
local cut time: 00:02.083
```

When a chunk begins in the middle of a long shot, the entire text body of that
active shot is retained. Natural-language prose cannot be safely divided at an
arbitrary frame boundary. The carried video/audio latent tail establishes the
actual starting state so the model can continue rather than recreate the shot
from its textual beginning.

## Replacing only prompt-owned conditioning

The original prompt has already been processed by MiniMax's Qwen3-VL text
encoder when it reaches the guider. Arbitrary text cannot be inserted directly
into the final hidden-state tensor. The node therefore needs the original
`clip` and prompt.

For each chunk it tokenizes and encodes the rewritten prompt, then replaces
only these positive-conditioning fields:

```text
cross_attn
minimax_token_tags
```

These are the fields owned by the Qwen prompt presentation. The node does not
replace latent references, keyframes, controls, sampler settings, or unrelated
metadata.

## What the `images` input means

The optional `images` input is used only to reconstruct Qwen/CLIP visual
conditioning. It does not create H3 video-VAE or audio-VAE latents.

For ordinary I2VA/FL2VA conditioning, the image batch is interpreted as:

```text
images[0] -> <Picture 1> / original first-frame image
images[1] -> <Picture 2> / optional original last-frame image
```

The first image is resized to the generation canvas with the same stretched
geometry-anchor behavior used by the stock H3 node. Later images use
aspect-preserving center crop, matching the stock last-frame behavior.

For image-only Ref2VA, each batch item is a separate picture reference:

```text
images[0] -> <Picture 1>
images[1] -> <Picture 2>
images[2] -> <Picture 3>
```

The image references are reconstructed in the same order as the existing
`minimax_refs` payload. Audio-only reference blocks contribute their `<Audio N>`
labels to Qwen but need no waveform here because their audio latents already
exist in `minimax_refs`.

This explains why the current node does not take a video VAE or audio VAE:

- the `images` input supplies only pixels for Qwen visual tokens;
- upstream keyframes and Ref2VA blocks are already VAE-encoded in the guider;
- previous generated video and audio are already available as sampled latents.

## Why an IMAGE batch is not a Ref2VA video

An IMAGE batch normally represents separate `<Picture N>` references. A
Ref2VA `<Video N>` has additional temporal structure:

- all frames belong to one ordered media item;
- Qwen samples the video at 2 FPS and inserts timestamps;
- the video VAE encodes the complete temporal sequence as one reference latent;
- an optional synchronized soundtrack is encoded by the audio VAE;
- the prompt refers to the sequence as `<Video N>`, not as many pictures.

Consequently, the node refuses existing `video` or `video_audio` Ref2VA blocks
when rebuilding Qwen conditioning from `images`. Silently treating those frames
as separate pictures would make the Qwen presentation disagree with the DiT
reference payload.

Correct support for new Ref2VA videos would require dedicated inputs such as:

- one or more separately delimited `ref_video` IMAGE sequences;
- the MiniMax video VAE;
- optional reference-video audio and the MiniMax audio VAE;
- an explicit choice between a full reusable reference and a reference aligned
  one-to-one with the target's global timeline.

For a timeline-aligned source, each chunk would have to slice the raw frames,
snap them to H3's temporal grid, sample the same slice at 2 FPS for Qwen,
VAE-encode the slice, and replace the corresponding `minimax_refs` video block.
If it has synchronized audio, that audio must be sliced and encoded on the same
timeline. For identity, appearance, general motion, camera, or style references,
the complete reference video should normally remain available to every chunk
instead of being timeline-sliced.

None of this is needed for continuation from the immediately preceding
generated chunk; direct latent-tail guides are the more accurate path.

## Stock sampler delegation and output assembly

Every planned chunk is placed in a temporary latent dictionary and passed to:

```python
SamplerCustomAdvanced.execute(...)
```

This preserves ComfyUI's normal sampler, sigma, callback, preview, model
loading, offloading, dtype, and backend behavior. The custom node does not
implement a separate diffusion sampler.

Both stock outputs are collected:

```text
output
denoised_output
```

Continuation prefixes are trimmed from both, and their video and audio streams
are concatenated independently. The final tensors are wrapped in a new
`NestedTensor`. Their shapes match the original upstream H3 AV latent exactly.

Non-H3 or non-nested latents fall through to the stock sampler unchanged.

## Current limitations

- Chunking reduces temporal DiT memory, not the memory required for one
  high-resolution frame. It cannot guarantee arbitrary spatial resolution.
- The upstream H3 latent nodes may impose their own user-interface duration
  maximum even though the sampler planner itself works with longer valid
  latents.
- Chunked denoise masks are rejected. Slicing and synchronizing nested AV masks
  needs a separate, explicitly designed path.
- New Ref2VA video media is unsupported for the reasons above. Existing image
  and audio reference presentations can be rebuilt.
- Prompt cut timing remains generative guidance. Rewriting a cut to the correct
  local timestamp does not make diffusion frame-exact in the way a deterministic
  video editor would be.
- Full-reference prefix analysis sections remain present even when their
  detailed shots are outside the current chunk. They preserve label meanings,
  but may still describe the overall video rather than only the local window.
- I2VA/FL2VA picture instructions describe a global target. Reusing those
  pictures in later chunks can provide identity or destination context, but the
  previous latent tail remains the actual local start-state constraint.

## Verification performed

The implementation was checked with the Python environment used by the running
ComfyUI installation.

Completed checks include:

- Python compilation of `__init__.py` and `nodes.py`;
- loading through ComfyUI's real `load_custom_node` path;
- schema registration with the expected node id and all new inputs;
- a planner matrix covering 212 H3 durations and eight chunk settings;
- exact reconstructed video/audio shapes for mocked multi-chunk sampling;
- eight-versus-nine-step audio boundary trimming;
- restoration of the guider's original conditioning after sampling;
- remapping of global first/last-frame keyframes;
- replacement of `cross_attn` and `minimax_token_tags` for every chunk;
- official base-prompt and full-reference description field parsing;
- conversion of global frame 100 to local frame 50 / `00:02.083` at 24 FPS;
- strict rejection of malformed or non-increasing shot markers;
- reconstruction of image/audio Ref2VA presentation order;
- clear rejection of video Ref2VA conditioning from an IMAGE-only input.

A full MiniMax H3 GPU render was not run as part of the lightweight automated
verification. The mocked path exercised chunk planning, prompt replacement,
conditioning mutation, continuation guide construction, trimming, and final
shape assembly without loading the large model.
